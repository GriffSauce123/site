                        <p>
                            When I was eleven years old, I was given a little laptop for my birthday. Contingent on this gift was the addition of parental controls installed to limit the amount of time I would spend on the device. Microsoft family was the most straightforward setup. I was fine with this, and I still think it is a lovely idea to limit the time we spend digitally especially when young.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once I entered highschool, I had friends that wanted to play video games together, projects I wanted to do, and videos on topics I was interested to watch. The expression of these desires were limited ( for good reason; thanks parents! ) Naturally, given my problem solving and "fine, I will do it myself" mindset, I started scheming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The simplest solution was to ask my parents to grant more time after I had completed my obligations for the day, or send a request and hope they blindly accepted it. This only worked occasionally. The second strategy would be to grant myself administrator privileges to be able to extend screentime requests myself. I liked the challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course at 14 years old I would begin searching for an exact solution for what I needed, "how to remove / extend screentime limits windows 10" and this was not very fruitful. Eventually I discovered a way to access the file system of the device by forcing it to boot into recovery ( shift + restart ) and pretending to install a driver.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next step was pointing certain filenames and utilities to other programs to access an administrator command prompt on the lock screen. ( forgive my lack of detail, to some extent it can still be used maliciously ) From this point it was trivial to alter account permissions and add local administrator accounts outside the Microsoft family ecosystem. We were golden.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was distributing bonus screentime left and right. To myself, to my brothers, to anyone. It took only days for my parents to notice the discrepancies. Clueless to the mechanism behind it, they simply requested that we stop. To some extent we did, or at least limited its use to weekends.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A few weeks later, I realized that it is an interesting and "useful" enough bug to show to others. I began by demonstrating to my father who’s face showed both impressed and concerned. Then, I think it is a splendid idea to create a youtube video showing the world what can be done with this exploit! Thankfully it only got around 2000 views before it was forcefully deleted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because I saw how YouTube and my father reacted to this information, I decided it would be best to report the issue to Microsoft themselves. Through a little contact form I submitted this little bug and expected to hear nothing ever again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Astonishingly, a few weeks later I received a phone call from an unrecognized number. Unfamiliar with the Seattle area code, this turns out to be a Microsoft representative wanting to hear the whole story. He wants to know every detail and all use cases I could come up with for this bug. I spent an hour on the phone with this gentleman, being as detailed as 14 year old me could be. I emailed screenshots, pictures of my monitor, and step by step instructions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the time I thought this guy wasn't taking it seriously, and I was acting frantic after the realization of that access this could provide. You could change and remove account passwords at the very least. After the unenthusiastic response to my reporting, I didn't expect anything to come of this experience. I forgot about it all and went on with my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fast forward to two years later, and I am setting up a ticketing desk for the highschool in one of my classes. This requires administrator access to this device which is managed on the network. Nobody in the class knew the password to the admin account. Not the instructor, not the head of the department.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I timidly speak up, suggesting that I could likely get in. Since everyone else was stumped, I gave it a shot. Everything goes smoothly at first, boot into the recovery screen, go to "install a driver" and boom: hit with a password prompt. Microsoft fixed the issue.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the moment this led to annoyance and frustration, but as a whole this marked a real improvement that I helped bring into the world. Hidden within the depths of Windows 10, only expert tomfoolers would discover, is a solution to a problem that I connected the dots on. And yes, I still got into that school machine.

                    <div class="invis">
                        <p>
                            During my senior year in high school, I got an internship with the city in which I lived. I was brought onto a small commercial real estate project, aimed at updating and conglomerating data to make better decisions when redesigning the downtown area. Though this was through the IT pathway program, I had done a lot of work on business analytics and project management principles.
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong><i>State of the Project:</i></strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Reliable, current, and accessible data for these buildings did not exist.<br>
                            The assessor's database became the main source of data, but it was difficult and time-consuming to find important metrics.<br>
                            A previous project member had created a spreadsheet to consolidate the collected data, including Property ID, Property Location, Previous or Current Tenant, Type of Business, and Owner. ( To be done by hand )<br>
                            I was given a set of  desired metrics to look for with each property.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong><i>My Responsibilities:</i></strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Initially, I was tasked with creating a project outline proposal, outlining the present state of the project, the goal of the project, and the steps to get there.<br>
                            I interviewed government employees, commercial real estate agents, and members of the community in order to best determine the most vital metrics to track and make available.<br>
                            I sought approval directly from the Mayor’s office, walking them through the project proposal and the timeline I had developed.<br>
                            Once another intern was onboarded, I was tasked with filling them in, and assisting in the delegation of tasks.<br>
                            We were to manually locate, clean, and upload the data for each property by hand from the assessors database PDF documents.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong><i>My Scheme:</i></strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            Though we spent a week manually locating and filling in data, I was disheartened by the repetition, and the inefficiency of the whole operation.<br>
                            I noticed that all the documents were stored in an S3 bucket with a convenient url structure, giving me the ability to locate each document by parcel id ( we were given the IDs of the properties of interest )<br>
                            At this point I was essentially ignoring my manual data entry task, but writing a program that would pull each pdf document from the s3 bucket onto the machine doing the data analysis.<br>
                            The next challenge was extracting meaningful data from the pdf, which was not set up in a machine-readable way. Data points were in different places, with slightly different labels, and everything was a mess.<br>
                            Trial and error was how I spent the next few days. Scouring through the documents to find rough pixel coordinates where each metric was positioned.<br>
                            I increased the tolerance until each metric contained the desired data as well as the label ( and usually a lot of fluff information as well ), and now I had to clean and filter the data in a more accessible format.<br>
                            Since I was writing everything in Python, it was an incredibly easy choice to use the regular expression library ( regex ) in order to return only the values and the labels that were of interest.<br>
                            Multi-line and more complex metrics required algorithms that looped through data points, and calculated a final result before returning anything. ( Anything that needed to be summed )<br>
                            Once data was in a raw form, it was appended into a csv file automatically with the parcel ID as the primary key. SQL would have been too technical for those overseeing the project.<br>
                        </p>
                        <h3><strong><i>Result:</i></strong></h3>
                        <p>
                            I spent approximately five days on this project, which slowed our progress significantly. My program, once finished, completed a full week's worth of manual entry in less than ten minutes. ( downloading hundreds of PDF files to a dusty office PC is not blisteringly fast )<br>
                            My coworker no longer had a job to do, so we transitioned into taking up-to-date, clear, high quality photos for each roadside property on the list.<br>
                            Now, a couple of years later, the results of this project are being utilized to redesign Main St. making sure that each property is not adversely affected due to reduced frontage, lot size, zoning, or visibility. Now that there is a reflective abundance of data, informed decisions can be made more efficiently.<br>
                            Nobody overseeing the project had any expectation of automation, or internal tool development. There was a short period of time where we were scratching our heads as there was no more work to do. I am proud of my work on this project.<br>

                        <p>
                            Just two months into my freshman year of college, I attended an entrepreneurship event with on campus startups present. I was outrageously nervous, going to some large event alone was and still is not my cup of tea.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The beginning chunk of the event was listening to a venture capital partner speak on all sorts of aspects of an early stage business. A comprehensive professional history was given, stories from different facets of his life were given to us. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the Q&A portion, I was able to clarify some of the regrets, miscalculated risks, and disappointments of the speaker's experience. To summarize there were three main points: 
                        
                        <br>&emsp;# Try a lot of things, don’t hold yourself back.<br>
                        &emsp;# Timing is really important, but it is the one thing you cannot force.<br>
                        &emsp;# Don’t dwell on the failures, learn from them and move on.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Believe it or not, this talk inspired me to become more outgoing and talkative during the networking dinner half of the event. I talked to a variety of students from all grade levels, majors, and plans forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The story gets real once I start chatting with the founders of each startup. There is palpable brilliance and ambition bubbling from each table I walk past. After four or five tables, I slide myself into a conversation about development troubles and paths forward with two guys from a startup called Campus Intro.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These gentlemen ( Senior and Sophomore at the time ) are creating a platform where a prospective student can book a one-on-one call with an active student at any school for a raw, honest take. Positioned at students looking into schools a plane flight away, this was a more affordable and less time consuming way to get a feel for an institution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We talked business. I had just a month prior, begun development on my own startup ( mentioned later ) and so had the perfect skillset to assist in their development. One video chat with the whole team later and I was in. I really do hate how powerful connections can be in today's job market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working as a technical consultant, my first task was to evaluate their code, designs, and plans. I am unable to go into exhaustive detail, but things were a mess. The backend was set, functionality was essentially done by one member of their team, so I took what was left and ran. The team had some semblance of a brand image, they had paid a fiverr artist to make a mockup landing page which I was to improve on. I took the colors, fonts, and one component from that design and redid their entire canva board. It took me three weeks, but the feedback during and after was overwhelmingly positive. Next came the implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project had been built using a standard combination of React and Tailwind, making it straightforward to begin refactoring the frontend. I started with the global variables and elements, making sure the site was cohesive and remained functional even on the slow dev branch. Next I worked tirelessly bringing the landing page to life, next the hero section, calls to action, testimonials, and sample posts were all meticulously placed for fluid navigation and reading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The one thing this company had completely omitted from the plan was a responsive design. When one designs a webpage, it is essential to understand that people have different devices, which all have different size screens. I spent an entire month making sure no content was concealed unintentionally. I developed and implemented their entire responsive design to ensure any desktop, laptop, tablet, phone, or even smartwatch user would be able to make sense of the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Founding team is very happy. 😇
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Due to exigent circumstances which I am not at liberty to discuss, this company has suspended development and operations until some future date. I wish Campus Intro and their team the best, and I hope they stick with their idea.
