                    <h3>Where I am Now</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; Though interested in a wide variety of disciplines, I am currently majoring in business administration at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University. Throughout my short time here I have been able to meet such amazing people beyond my wildest expectations. I have attended events and webinars and learned detailed and actionable bits of information as well as hearing peoples unique experiences. I have had the privledge to complete my own little projects, assist peers with thiers, and consult for small companies for fun. Not only am I getting the most out of this educational juggernaught, I feel that I am utilizing all that this diverse environment has to offer.</p>
                    <h3>From the Beginning</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; When I say the beginning, we are going back quite a while. When I was in the third grade a number of after-school clubs materialized and were offerred to all the students. Since my parents were working later than the school day ended, it was only natural to have me pick a club to attend. Reviewing the options it was an obvious decision to join the Lego Robotics club. This was my introduction into anything techy, as only this year had we begun typing on the little public school ipads. Despite our age, this club was an amazing opportunity to learn about giving computers instructions, super basic algorythms, working around obstacles, and teamwork. The repetitiveness of it all was assuring as well, we knew what to do if our robot crashed into the wall, or if it fell down the stairs. We were able to work together and not only build the robot, but write the conditional instruction sets to compete as a team later on. I cannot remember in vivid detail everything that was done, or the concrete skills learned, but I know this was the first stepping stone down the path I have found myself on today.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; Jumping to grade six, I have begun a common theme in my life of scheming. For as long as I can remember ideas just appear in my mind without notice. It is a very entrepreneurial characteristic, however most of the time (especially at that age) were rediculous. It is innapropriate to evaluate an idea without analysis and research. The first idea I executed resulted in selling little oragami pieces to other students. I recognized that I could produce these creations with supplies which I possessed already in very little time. I recognized that friends and peers would ask me to make them so demand was real. As silly as this endeavor was, I did also learn how to operate under the radar, spread the business by word of mouth alone, and managing inventory. (Let me be clear: I was eleven and made a total of $14 before I was shut down)  </p>

                    <h3>Highschool</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; Three long years later I enroll at the local highschool. Not planning on anything special or interesting I had signed up for an introductory Python class. I was a bit dissapointed in this class at first, having learned a little Java during a two week summer camp in an adjacent town. Very little actual programming went on, essentially just loops, variables, and the most basic and repetitive functions you can imagine. This being said I was intrigued and felt a connection to the instructor meaning I would continue learning outside of class and display my odd little programs the next day in class to my friends and the instructor. (Multiple viruses and truly pointless programs were developed.) Needless to say I was enjoying this environment. A number of times the instructor pushed me to join a special tech program that the school offered where you take more advanced technical classes and do an internship at the end. I was not enthused about being in some sort of program at this point. And then Covid shut everything down.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; After the vacation facade wore off and I got bored, I found myself fiddling with and watching videos on python programming. My first few real projects were simple little games that I would play with my brother. While tutorials were followed I was learning more complex concepts than were taught in the class. Nothing worth sharing was created at this point, just little projects that barely worked. Months past and I am finally convinced to join the special tech program within the highschool. The first class I took was basic robotics and electronics. We essentially learned the absolute basics of circuits and begun fooling around with Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to make lights, sounds, actuate motors, and blow up LEDs with far too much current. This class is where I met another instructor that bears responsibility for who I have become. The lively, experiemental, curious atmosphere caused everyone in the class to go off and dive into what they found interesting. At one point a small group that I was part of constructed these little cars from kits using Raspberry Pi components and were having trouble with the builtin software. Instead of troubleshooting and reading the instructions from multiple websites, we decided to execute our "creative" problem solving skills. The worst idea we put into practice was duct taping a phone camera onto the car while a video call was up, and controlling the car through ssh on a program we wrote ourselves. Many classrooms were invaded by our creation. </p>
                    <p>&emsp; Just about the same time, in my free time I decided to try some machine learning projects. I spent hours on YouTube watching concept videos and tutorials. Since the hardware I had access to at the time was less than stelar, I was only able to work with small models. I began by creating an optical character recognition model that acheived results on par with examples I was following on the internet. This was incredibly dull in my eyes, so I decided to move on to object recognition on GPU. Again a really simple project but I spun it up in a few hours on an old office pc with a gtx 1650 jammed into the side. With reasonable accuracy it was able to follow myself and things I held in front of the camera. Unable to come up with any origional ideas within my realm of understanding, I built another little image classification algorythm. Cat? Dog? Skunk? Let's just say it didn't go well.</p>
