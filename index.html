                    <h3>Where I am Now</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; Though interested in a wide variety of disciplines, I am currently majoring in business administration at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University. Throughout my short time here I have been able to meet such amazing people beyond my wildest expectations. I have attended events and webinars and learned detailed and actionable bits of information as well as hearing peoples unique experiences. I have had the privledge to complete my own little projects, assist peers with thiers, and consult for small companies for fun. Not only am I getting the most out of this educational juggernaught, I feel that I am utilizing all that this diverse environment has to offer.</p>
                    <h3>From the Beginning</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; When I say the beginning, we are going back quite a while. When I was in the third grade a number of after-school clubs materialized and were offerred to all the students. Since my parents were working later than the school day ended, it was only natural to have me pick a club to attend. Reviewing the options it was an obvious decision to join the Lego Robotics club. This was my introduction into anything techy, as only this year had we begun typing on the little public school ipads. Despite our age, this club was an amazing opportunity to learn about giving computers instructions, super basic algorythms, working around obstacles, and teamwork. The repetitiveness of it all was assuring as well, we knew what to do if our robot crashed into the wall, or if it fell down the stairs. We were able to work together and not only build the robot, but write the conditional instruction sets to compete as a team later on. I cannot remember in vivid detail everything that was done, or the concrete skills learned, but I know this was the first stepping stone down the path I have found myself on today.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; Jumping to grade six, I have begun a common theme in my life of scheming. For as long as I can remember ideas just appear in my mind without notice. It is a very entrepreneurial characteristic, however most of the time (especially at that age) were rediculous. It is innapropriate to evaluate an idea without analysis and research. The first idea I executed resulted in selling little oragami pieces to other students. I recognized that I could produce these creations with supplies which I possessed already in very little time. I recognized that friends and peers would ask me to make them so demand was real. As silly as this endeavor was, I did also learn how to operate under the radar, spread the business by word of mouth alone, and managing inventory. (Let me be clear: I was eleven and made a total of $14 before I was shut down)  </p>

                    <h3>Highschool</h3>
                    <p>&emsp; Three long years later I enroll at the local highschool. Not planning on anything special or interesting I had signed up for an introductory Python class. I was a bit dissapointed in this class at first, having learned a little Java during a two week summer camp in an adjacent town. Very little actual programming went on, essentially just loops, variables, and the most basic and repetitive functions you can imagine. This being said I was intrigued and felt a connection to the instructor meaning I would continue learning outside of class and display my odd little programs the next day in class to my friends and the instructor. (Multiple viruses and truly pointless programs were developed.) Needless to say I was enjoying this environment. A number of times the instructor pushed me to join a special tech program that the school offered where you take more advanced technical classes and do an internship at the end. I was not enthused about being in some sort of program at this point. And then Covid shut everything down.</p>
                    <p>&emsp; After the vacation facade wore off and I got bored, I found myself fiddling with and watching videos on python programming. My first few real projects were simple little games that I would play with my brother. While tutorials were followed I was learning more complex concepts than were taught in the class. Nothing worth sharing was created at this point, just little projects that barely worked. Months past and I am finally convinced to join the special tech program within the highschool. The first class I took was basic robotics and electronics. We essentially learned the absolute basics of circuits and begun fooling around with Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to make lights, sounds, actuate motors, and blow up LEDs with far too much current. This class is where I met another instructor that bears responsibility for who I have become. The lively, experiemental, curious atmosphere caused everyone in the class to go off and dive into what they found interesting. At one point a small group that I was part of constructed these little cars from kits using Raspberry Pi components and were having trouble with the builtin software. Instead of troubleshooting and reading the instructions from multiple websites, we decided to execute our "creative" problem solving skills. The worst idea we put into practice was duct taping a phone camera onto the car while a video call was up, and controlling the car through ssh on a program we wrote ourselves. Many classrooms were invaded by our creation. </p>
                    <p>&emsp; Just about the same time, in my free time I decided to try some machine learning projects. I spent hours on YouTube watching concept videos and tutorials. Since the hardware I had access to at the time was less than stelar, I was only able to work with small models. I began by creating an optical character recognition model that acheived results on par with examples I was following on the internet. This was incredibly dull in my eyes, so I decided to move on to object recognition on GPU. Again a really simple project but I spun it up in a few hours on an old office pc with a gtx 1650 jammed into the side. With reasonable accuracy it was able to follow myself and things I held in front of the camera. Unable to come up with any origional ideas within my realm of understanding, I built another little image classification algorythm. Cat? Dog? Skunk? Let's just say it didn't go well.</p>

                <h2>My Projects</h2>
                <h3>Big Sad Game</h3>
                <p>The first project which I considered to be "complete" Written in python, this project required the use of multithreading, complex classes, and handling efficient loops. You play as a happy block that has to dodge falling obstacles that increase with speed over time. Your score is directly correlated to the time alive. Controlled randomly, this game had the need for colision handling and event prioritization. For something that I built when I was 14, I am proud of this game titled "Big Sad".</p>
                <h3>Hacking Windows</h3>
                <p>
                    This project requires quite a bit of backstory. When I was eleven years old, I was given a little laptop for my birthday. Contingent on this gift was the addition of parental controls installed to limit the amount of time I would spend on the device. Microsoft family was the most straightforward setup.
                    I was fine with this, and I still think it is a lovely idea to limit the time we spend digitally expecially when young. Once I entered highschool, I had friends that wanted to play video games together, projects I wanted to do, and videos on topics I was interetsed to watch. The expression of these desires were limited ( for good reason; thanks parents! ) 
                    Naturally, given my problem solving and "fine, I will do it myself" mindset, I started scheming. The simplest solution was to ask my parents to grant more time after I had completed my obligations for the day, or send a request and hope they blindly accepted it. This only worked occasionally.
                    The second strategy would be to grant myself administrator privelges to be able to extend screentime requests myself. I liked the challenge. Of course at 14 years old I would begin searching for an exact solution for what I needed, "how to remove / extend screentime limites windows 10" and this was not very fruitful. 
                    Eventually I discovered a way to access the file system of the device by forcing it to boot into recovery ( shift + restart ) and pretneding to install a driver. The next step was pointing certain filenames and utilities to other programs to access an administrator command prompt on the lock screen. ( forgive my lack of detail, to some extent it can still be used maliciously )
                    From this point it was trivial to alter account permissions and add local administrator accounts outside the Microsoft family ecosystem. We were golden. I was distributing bonus screentime left and right, to myself to my brothers, anyone. It took only days for my parents to notice the discrepencies. Clueless to the mechanism behind it, they simply requested that we stop doing it.
                    To some extent we did stop, at least limited it to weekends. A few weeks later, I realize that it is an interesting and "useful" enough thing to show to others. I begin by demonstrating to my father who is a bit impressed and a bit concerned. Then I think it is a splendid idea to create a youtube video showing the world what can be done with this exploit! Thankfully it only got around 2000 views before it was deleted.
                    Because I saw how YouTube and my father reacted to this information, I decided it would best to report the issue to Microsoft themselves. Through a little contact form I submitted this little bug and expected to hear nothing ever again. A few weeks later, astonishingly, I recieve a phone call from a seattle area code. This turns out to be a Microsoft representative wanting to hear the whole story, every detail, and the use cases for this bug.
                    I spent about an hour on the phone with this Microsoft employee, being as detailed as 14 year old me could be. I emailed screenshots, pictures of my monitor, and step by step instructions. Most of the time I thought that this guy wasn't taking it seriously, and I was being almost frantic after the realization of that access this provides. You can change and remove account passwords at the very least.
                    Needless to say I didn't expect anything to come of this experience. I forgot about it all and went on with my life.<br><br>Around two years later, I am setting up a ticketing desk for the highschool in one of my classes. This requires administrator access to this device which is managed on the network. Nobody in the class knew the password to the admin account. Not the instructor, not the head of the department. I timidly speak up, suggesting that I could likely get in. Since everyone else was stumped, I give it a shot.
                    Everything goes smoothly at first, boot into the recovery screen, go to "install a driver" and boom: hit with a password prompt. Microsoft had fixed the issue. In the moment this lead to annoyance and frustration, but as a whole this marked a real improvement that I helped bring into the world. Hidden within the depths of Windows 10, only expert tomfoolers would discover, is a solution to a problem that I connected the dots on. And yes, I still got into that school machine 😉.

                <h3>Cybersecurity Class Adventures</h3>
                <p>My Junior year of high school, I was lucky enough to take the intro to cybersecurity class offered. This was taught by an instructor that I enjoyed working with previously. In the beginning there were a lot of readings, slides, and little labs on virtual machines. After that period, we were put into groups based on the tables we were seated at. Every other week we would create a presentation loosly relevant to the classwork of the week ( these presentations were really silly ). Around this time the instructor put a class point system in place on the class website, Harry Potter style. During each class we would be assigned points for participation, answering questions, and going above and beyond in your interest in cybersecurity. In contrast you could have points taken away for misbehaving or being unproductive. My team was in the lead by a few points, but there was a presentation coming up that would probably ruin our numbers ( humor was our strong suit ). I had the genius idea to attempt a point heist by hacking into this instructors website and changing the numbers myself. I knew it was hosted on wordpress, since we had set up portfolio websites in an earlier class using that domain. Through my research I was abnle to find a little query you could attach in order to reveal the administrator username. The next part was a bit of luck to be honest. Trying the basic passwords did not work, and I was lost. Chatting with some friends about this endeavor lead to an interesting finding; one guy I knew had worked on a project with this instructor and was granted a password for that. In the very next class, not paying attension to anything going on I try the login. Instantly I see the admin dashboard, plugins, pages, posts, users, I was in disbelilef. The steps I took next were vital to this plans success. First I added 20,000 points to my teams ledger ( we only had 2000 previously ), then </p>
