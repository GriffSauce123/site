                    <h2>Windows Vulnerability</h2>
                    <p>
                        When I was eleven years old, I was given a little laptop for my birthday. Contingent on this gift was the addition of parental controls installed to limit the amount of time I would spend on the device. Microsoft family was the most straightforward setup. I was fine with this, and I still think it is a lovely idea to limit the time we spend digitally especially when young.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once I entered highschool, I had friends that wanted to play video games together, projects I wanted to do, and videos on topics I was interested to watch. The expression of these desires were limited ( for good reason; thanks parents! ) Naturally, given my problem solving and "fine, I will do it myself" mindset, I started scheming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplest solution was to ask my parents to grant more time after I had completed my obligations for the day, or send a request and hope they blindly accepted it. This only worked occasionally. The second strategy would be to grant myself administrator privileges to be able to extend screentime requests myself. I liked the challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of course at 14 years old I would begin searching for an exact solution for what I needed, "how to remove / extend screentime limits windows 10" and this was not very fruitful. Eventually I discovered a way to access the file system of the device by forcing it to boot into recovery ( shift + restart ) and pretending to install a driver.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step was pointing certain filenames and utilities to other programs to access an administrator command prompt on the lock screen. ( forgive my lack of detail, to some extent it can still be used maliciously ) From this point it was trivial to alter account permissions and add local administrator accounts outside the Microsoft family ecosystem. We were golden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was distributing bonus screentime left and right. To myself, to my brothers, to anyone. It took only days for my parents to notice the discrepancies. Clueless to the mechanism behind it, they simply requested that we stop. To some extent we did, or at least limited its use to weekends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A few weeks later, I realized that it is an interesting and "useful" enough bug to show to others. I began by demonstrating to my father who’s face showed both impressed and concerned. Then, I think it is a splendid idea to create a youtube video showing the world what can be done with this exploit! Thankfully it only got around 2000 views before it was forcefully deleted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because I saw how YouTube and my father reacted to this information, I decided it would be best to report the issue to Microsoft themselves. Through a little contact form I submitted this little bug and expected to hear nothing ever again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Astonishingly, a few weeks later I received a phone call from an unrecognized number. Unfamiliar with the Seattle area code, this turns out to be a Microsoft representative wanting to hear the whole story. He wants to know every detail and all use cases I could come up with for this bug. I spent an hour on the phone with this gentleman, being as detailed as 14 year old me could be. I emailed screenshots, pictures of my monitor, and step by step instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the time I thought this guy wasn't taking it seriously, and I was acting frantic after the realization of that access this could provide. You could change and remove account passwords at the very least. After the unenthusiastic response to my reporting, I didn't expect anything to come of this experience. I forgot about it all and went on with my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fast forward to two years later, and I am setting up a ticketing desk for the highschool in one of my classes. This requires administrator access to this device which is managed on the network. Nobody in the class knew the password to the admin account. Not the instructor, not the head of the department.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I timidly speak up, suggesting that I could likely get in. Since everyone else was stumped, I gave it a shot. Everything goes smoothly at first, boot into the recovery screen, go to "install a driver" and boom: hit with a password prompt. Microsoft fixed the issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the moment this led to annoyance and frustration, but as a whole this marked a real improvement that I helped bring into the world. Hidden within the depths of Windows 10, only expert tomfoolers would discover, is a solution to a problem that I connected the dots on. And yes, I still got into that school machine.

                    <h2>Real Estate Proejct</h2>
                    <p>
                        During my senior year in high school, I got an internship with the city in which I lived. I was brought onto a small commercial real estate project, aimed at updating and conglomerating data to make better decisions when redesigning the downtown area. Though this was through the IT pathway program, I had done a lot of work on business analytics and project management principles.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong><i>State of the Project:</i></strong></h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reliable, current, and accessible data for these buildings did not exist.</li>
                        <li>The assessor's database became the main source of data, but it was difficult and time-consuming to find important metrics.</li>
                        <li>A previous project member had created a spreadsheet to consolidate the collected data, including Property ID, Property Location, Previous or Current Tenant, Type of Business, and Owner. ( To be done by hand )</li>
                        <li>I was given a set of  desired metrics to look for with each property.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3><strong><i>My Responsibilities:</i></strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially, I was tasked with creating a project outline proposal, outlining the present state of the project, the goal of the project, and the steps to get there.<br>
                        I interviewed government employees, commercial real estate agents, and members of the community in order to best determine the most vital metrics to track and make available.<br>
                        I sought approval directly from the Mayor’s office, walking them through the project proposal and the timeline I had developed.<br>
                        Once another intern was onboarded, I was tasked with filling them in, and assisting in the delegation of tasks.<br>
                        We were to manually locate, clean, and upload the data for each property by hand from the assessors database PDF documents.<br>
